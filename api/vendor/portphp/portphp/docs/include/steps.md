First install the [Steps package](https://github.com/portphp/steps), which
includes the StepAggregator:

```bash
$ composer require portphp/steps
```

And include Composerâ€™s autoloader in your project:

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

For integration with Symfony projects, a 
[PortSymfonyBundle](https://github.com/portphp/symfony-bundle) is available.
